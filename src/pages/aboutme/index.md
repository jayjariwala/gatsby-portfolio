**_Introduction.._**

Hello! My name is Jay Jariwala, I am a Full-stack web developer based in New Jersey, USA. I love to design and develop web applications. I am currently available for the full-time positions, so If you are a recruiter and looking to hire a developer with a passion for learning new technology, feel free to email me at jay.jariwala@hotmail.com. 

**_A little more…_**

I was born and raised in Surat; aka the diamond city of Gujarat, India. The days of my childhood were pretty average; a little bit of study, Fun with friends and outdoor sports can literally sum up my childhood. I think I was 15 years old when I first got introduced to Computers and fell in love with digital video games, Computer graphics, and The World Wide Web. 

**_Education…_**

Coming from a wealthy family background, I was fortunate enough to pursue Computer Science as my carrier. I’ve studied Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from Gujarat Technological University and Master of Science in Computer Science from Fairleigh Dickinson University. All of my academic achievements belongs to my lovely parents, without their help and support I couldn’t have gotten the best education.

**_Who am I as a person…_** 

Personality-type wise my friends would describe me as an introvert. A little shy at first but very friendly and open-minded once familiar. I like the saying that “There is no substitute of hard-work” and I believe it to be true. I am a very workaholic type, most of the times I get hyper-focused into my work and forget about my surroundings. I like to help and inspire others whether it be someone online or in real. I like to live minimal life, cutting off on things that don’t necessarily add any value to my life.

**_A love for Web Development…_**

I’ve previously worked on few Web Applications projects during my bachelor degree but I got really interested in web development when I first found out about FreeCodeCamp.org community. I started with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and couldn’t stop myself learning more about web technologies.
